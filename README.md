# Image-Analysis
•	Predicted images with 97% accuracy using convolutional deep neural network models with 70,000 images of cloths, accessories, handwritten letters and numbers, and landmarks
•	Developed and compared image recognition models with and without convolutional and pooling layers on top of the neural network and deep neural network algorithms
•	Utilized Python programming language with open-source libraries like TensorFlow, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, and sklearn to develop the predictive model
